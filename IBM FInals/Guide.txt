1. Current Mode-
In this mode, the user will be able to get the wind speed and 
the power generated by the turbine in a hour. The user has to enter 
the name of the area he wants the data about, then the app will provide
the requested data to the user. Moreover all the data that will be
collected will be stored in the form of an excel sheet, for the
user to analyze later. 
2. Prediction Mode-
In this mode, the user has to enter the date and the name of area of
which he/she wants the data about. Here user can enter any date from
future or past and get the amount of energy that will be generated 
by the wind mill during 10am-5pm in that day considering all the 
weather conditions.Moreover, the program will also consider the power
requirement of the area mentioned by the user. And if the requirements
are not satisfied by the power generated by wind turbine it will suggest
alternative methods to compensate the shortfall like solar, diesel etc based
on the availability. It will also sugest ideal timings to use respective resources.
All the data will be stored in the form of excel sheet. The sheet will be renovated
everyday.
